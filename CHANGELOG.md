# Changelog

## 2026-09-26 — v0.1.0: first dataset, first site

- Initial dataset: 258 records from the LLMCheck Apple Silicon LLM Benchmark
  Database (CC BY 4.0) — 64 models, 16 chips (M1–M6), backends MLX, Ollama,
  LM Studio, llama.cpp; Q4_K_M plus 9 other quants. Every row carries source
  URL, retrieval date, and the exact quoted values; provenance classes
  (sourced / community / estimated) are badged on the site.
- Site: home, "what speed will I get" lookup (client-side filter over the
  committed JSON), per-hardware pages, per-model pages, cross-backend notes,
  data page with schema, changelog.
- Deterministic collectors and checks: `scripts/collect_llmcheck.py`,
  `scripts/check_data.py`, `scripts/build_site.py` (stdlib only, cached fetches).
- CI: data checks on every push; weekly release tagging workflow.
- Issue templates: data submission and corrections.
- Survey of existing projects completed (LocalScore, LLMCheck, llmconfigurator,
  Localmaxxing, Bench360, anubis-oss, r/LocalLLaMA threads); positioning
  documented on the home page with credits and links.
